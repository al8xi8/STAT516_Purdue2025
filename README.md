## Course Description

This course introduces probability theory and its applications in statistics, data science, and applied mathematics. Emphasis is on understanding probability models, random variables, and key distributions used across scientific fields. Students will develop skills in problem-solving, analytical reasoning, and probabilistic thinking to prepare for advanced courses in statistics. Topics include:

- Probability rules, conditional probability, and independence  
- Discrete random variables and distributions  
- Generating functions and standard discrete distributions  
- Continuous random variables and special distributions  
- Normal distribution and Central Limit Theorem  
- Multivariate discrete distributions  
- Multidimensional densities, convolutions, and transformations  
- Dependence, conditional distributions, expectations, covariance and correlation  
- Bivariate normal distribution
